# Cognitive Services Demo
## Thumbnail creation

### Overview
This demo calls the Cognitive Services Thumbnail API, passing in a photo and creating a thumbnail image in the _thumbnails sub-folder. 

After running this code, you can view the original and the generated thumbnail by opening a web page at http://localhost:8124/

### Setup

The following steps are required to run this sample code:

1. Sign up for an Azure account
2. Create a Computer Vision API key
3. Create the getkey.js file
4. Create _thumbnails folder

Details:

#### Sign up for an Azure account
You will need to install node to run this sample. You can download and install node from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Create a Computer Vision API key
You will need to create an API key for the Computer Vision Cognitive Service. To do this, sign up for an Azure account at [azure.com](http://azure.com). You can sign up for a Free Account.

#### Create the getkey.js file
To protect the API key, I did not check in the getkey.js file. You will need to create this file in the root folder. Add the following code to getkey.js

```javascript
(function() {
    var key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
    module.exports.getKey = function() {
        return key;
    }
    
}());
```

where xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is your API key.

#### Create _thumbnails folder

By default, the thumbnail images are stored in a subfolder named "_thumbnails". Create this folder before running the code.

### Run the sample.

To run the sample, open a command prompt, change to the root folder, and type the following command:

```
node createThumbnail.js
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8124/.
